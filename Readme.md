## Introduction

This repository includes a collection of computer graphics programs designed to demonstrate key concepts such as drawing algorithms, filling techniques, clipping algorithms, and basic animations. The programs were executed on the Turbo C++ platform using the graphics library.

## Programs Included

The repository contains the following programs:

1. **Boundary Fill Algorithm**
2. **Flood Fill Algorithm**
3. **Scrolling Text**
4. **Bresenham's Circle Drawing Algorithm**
5. **Bresenham's Line Drawing Algorithm**
6. **Digital Differential Analyzer (DDA) Line Drawing Algorithm**
7. **Midpoint Circle Drawing Algorithm**
8. **Midpoint Ellipse Drawing Algorithm**
9. **Line Clipping Algorithms**
10. **Drawing Basic Shapes (Lines, Circles, Rectangles, etc.)**
11. **Basic Animations**

## Prerequisites

To run these programs, you'll need:

- Turbo C++ (or a compatible C/C++ compiler with graphics support)
- Basic understanding of C programming
- Familiarity with computer graphics concepts

## How to Run

1. **Install Turbo C++:** Ensure that Turbo C++ is installed on your system. You can download it from various online sources or use an emulator like DOSBox to run it on modern systems.

2. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/DevadattaP/Computer-Graphics.git
   cd Computer-Graphics
   ```

3. **Open Turbo C++:**
   - Launch the Turbo C++ IDE.
   - Open the desired `.c` file from the cloned repository.

4. **Compile and Run:**
   - Compile the program using `Alt + F9`.
   - Run the program using `Ctrl + F9`.

## Program Descriptions

### 1. Boundary Fill Algorithm
   Implements the boundary fill technique for filling closed areas in graphics.

### 2. Flood Fill Algorithm
   Implements the flood fill technique, similar to the paint bucket tool in graphics software.

### 3. Scrolling Text
   Demonstrates text scrolling across the screen using the graphics library.

### 4. Bresenham's Circle Drawing Algorithm
   Efficiently draws circles using integer-based calculations.

### 5. Bresenham's Line Drawing Algorithm
   Draws lines with high precision using the Bresenham's algorithm.

### 6. DDA Line Drawing Algorithm
   Implements the DDA algorithm to draw lines by calculating intermediate points.

### 7. Midpoint Circle Drawing Algorithm
   Another approach to drawing circles using the midpoint method.

### 8. Midpoint Ellipse Drawing Algorithm
   Draws ellipses using the midpoint ellipse algorithm.

### 9. Line Clipping Algorithms
   Implements various algorithms for clipping lines, such as Cohen-Sutherland, Liang-Barsky, etc.

### 10. Drawing Basic Shapes
   Contains functions to draw basic shapes like lines, rectangles, and circles.

### 11. Basic Animations
   Demonstrates simple animations using the graphics library.
